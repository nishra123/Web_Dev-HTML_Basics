# Web_Dev-HTML_Basics
Here I put forth some most basic websites I made using HTML.


It was a small project though - creating a 'Rock Concert' website was a criteria for joining the Tech Society in our college.
I was a beginner at that time, didn't knew even the basic HTML at that time!
Saw Youtube videos and made Rock_Concert.html with most basic HTML (Without any colors - just a plain website!) as frontend and Google Forms as backend for collecting data!
